# Spirituality and Premodern Computing

Proposal for International Congress on Medieval Studies (ICMS) 2026 

## Importance

There are at least three ways to view the importance and timeliness of this session. First, it an understudied topic in itself: that is, how people in medieval societies use computational methods for spiritual purposes. Second, computational methods, especially those used for artificial intelligence, are “eating the world,” and understanding the roots of these methods may help us to adapt to rapidly changing conditions. Third, considering the ways computational spirituality was used in the past might help us to re-enchant our present.

## Method
We invite papers, perhaps with interactive demonstrations (in-person or online). Code can be hosted our our GitHub page, https://github.com/spirituality-and-premodern-computing

## Outreach
We will set up a special website to describe the session, and also announce it specifically to colleagues in the Societas Magica, which had a related session on Occult Computing at ICMS in 2024. Their session call was extended to two sessions because of its popularity.

## Description for Call for Papers

How did people in medieval societies use computational and algorithmic methods for engaging with the divine? This session explores premodern computing, from the computus and divinatory zairja, to the ars combinatoria of Llull, labyrinths, magic squares, and the numerological ordering of the cosmos, within diverse spiritual contexts. We invite presentations examining the design, use, and symbolic meaning of computational artifacts and practices in medieval Christian, Jewish, and Islamic traditions for spiritual purposes such as ritual ordering, contemplation and prayer, memorialization, and evangelization. We also invite papers on the history of disenchantment (and possibilities of re-enchantment) of these methods.
