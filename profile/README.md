# Spirituality and Premodern Computing

Proposal for International Congress on Medieval Studies (ICMS) 2026 

## Importance

There are at least three ways to view the importance and timeliness of this session. First, it is an understudied topic in itself: that is, how people in medieval societies used computation for spiritual purposes. Second, computational methods, especially those used for artificial intelligence, are — in tech mogul Marc Andreessen’s graphic analogy — “eating the world,” and understanding the roots of these methods may help us adapt to rapidly changing conditions. Third, reflecting on the computational spirituality of the past might help us to re-enchant our present.

## Method
We invite papers, with optional interactive demonstrations. Code can be hosted our our GitHub page, https://github.com/spirituality-and-premodern-computing

## Outreach

We will set up a special website to describe the session, and also announce it specifically to colleagues in the Societas Magica, which had a related session on Occult Computing at ICMS in 2024. Their session call was extended to two sessions because of its popularity.

## Description for Call for Papers

How did people in medieval societies use computations and algorithms to engage with the divine? This session explores spiritual use of premodern computing, such as the computus, divinatory zairja and the ars combinatoria of Llull, labyrinths, magic squares, and the numerological ordering of the cosmos. We invite presentations examining the design, use, and symbolic meaning of computational and algorithmic artifacts in medieval Christian, Jewish, and Islamic traditions used for spiritual purposes. These include practices such as ritual ordering, contemplation and prayer, memorialization, and evangelization. We also invite papers on the history of disenchantment (and possible re-enchantment) of these methods.
